        <p>Shouting resonated from every direction on the corner of 161 Street and Gerard Avenue in the Bronx on Tuesday night, as animated baseball fans reacted in restaurants and bars. The New York Yankees were playing the Red Sox at Fenway in Boston, yet the streets outside of Yankee Stadium were teeming with fans clad in pinstriped jerseys.</p>
        <p>“I’m a ride-or-die Yankees fan, no matter what,” said John Hawkins, 37, who took an hour’s-long subway ride from Brooklyn to watch the game at Billy’s Sports Bar. “Either way, a car or a train, I’m coming out to watch the Yankees.”
        <p>It was a disappointing night for the Yankees, who lost to the Red Sox 6-2 in a single-elimination game. But for local bars and restaurants, this season was a chance to chip away at losses incurred over Yankee Stadium’s 18-month closure and capitalize on baseball’s fandom before businesses slump in the offseason.</p>
        <p>“When [the Yankees] are doing well, so are other stores, but when it's the offseason, many of the stores are closed for the whole six months,” said Executive Director Cary Goodman of the 161 Street Business Improvement District, an organization dedicated to rejuvenating the community around Yankee Stadium. “When the pandemic hit, our guys had already been six months without any income because that's the nature of the economic cycle in this neighborhood.”</p>

        <p>Up the block from Billy’s Sports Bar is Yankee Tavern, a bar allegedly frequented by Babe Ruth at one point in history, according to John Bastone, 66, the bar’s owner. He said Yankee Tavern brought in as many as 80 people at one point during Tuesday’s game. That’s more than double the patrons his business usually sees on a regular night during the offseason, but still a far cry away from how things were before the pandemic.</p>
        <p>“We did probably about half the business we did in 2019,” he said.</p>
        <p>While bars and restaurants had access to federal PPP loans and money through the SBA Restaurant Revitalization Fund to help keep their doors open, Bronx resident Cynthia Jones, 74, believes it was locals from the community who also stepped up to the plate.</p>
        <p>Jones, a professor of English at Hostos Community College, was part of a group that frequented the bar at Sam’s Soul Food, a nearby restaurant that’s closed on Mondays. But when Sam’s Soul Food pivoted to take-out-only during the pandemic Bastone’s bar became the go-to spot for Jones and others who live nearby. “Before Yankee Stadium opened back up, there was a Black popula-tion that supported this place,” she said.</p>
        <p>Joshua Velez, 32, bartends at Yankee Tavern and has lived in the Bronx his entire life. He says he’s thankful for the support of the local community. “Baseball has been a sport that's been around for over 200 years,” he said. “If it's not baseball that can bring us together, I don't know what it is.”</p>
        <p>For some, like Alfredo Torres, 25, who is also from the Bronx, going to a bar to watch the Yankees play is commonplace. “I want to be surrounded by Yankee fans for a game like this,” he said. “If I can help out small businesses, local businesses, and do my part as a Bronx resident, I'll do that any day.”</p>
